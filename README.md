# To Do List 📖
## Description 📝
To Do List is a tool that allows you to ***make a list of stuff*** you have to do! 🤠

With it, you won't forget anything! (*Unless you forget to write it down*) 😜

## How to use 🧰
It's so easy! Just **write** your new **task** in the *field located at the top of the page*! 😸

It must have at least **6 characters** to work 🕵️

You can **delete any task** just with their own button! There are also **other buttons** that have their own functionalities:
```
· RESET: It allows you to reset your tasks by default (with the first three ones)!
· DELETE ALL: It allows you to delete all the tasks!
```

Here is a photo of the homepage 😄
